      <h2>I dreamt of this on november 9th 2022</h2>
      <p1
        >i had a tiny plush of myself always with me; i was in a warped version
        of my school that was some kind of backrooms thingness; i struggled to
        stand still and i fainted all the time and i couldn't see well (as if i
        couldn't fully open my eyes/keep them open) i was in economy class and
        the teacher was extremely fat, like her hand was as big as my face, and
        she said she was growing claws on her knuckles and she was happy about
        it because she thought she'd become wolverine then i left the classroom
        and i fell down in the hallway and i started kind of floating and then
        people grouped around me to see what was happening then i wanted to go
        home and i found the force to get back up and i started walking around
        but the school was a massive 4 floor maze kind of rounded and it looked
        endless. I found a door that led to a train station i could use to go
        back home but i didn't take a train because i needed my backpack which
        for some reason I knew was at the entrance. I kept looking around until
        i found said entrance and then i somehow transitioned to being outside
        my house riding a bike, and a massive hornet was flying extremely close
        to my left ear making a horrible noise. Then i got home and there were
        cardboard boxes everywhere as if we had just moved and while going to my
        room i found a rat that came out of a box and i told my dad, and he
        stomped the rat to death and then everything went black and i woke
        up</p1
